# Diplomski-rad(AngularJS-App)

AngularJS Application for Cambridge Centre Learning School of Foreign Languages.
This web app served as my Bachelor thesis.
Developed using courses from Udemy, PluralSight, CodeSchools and other tutorials and books.
Project folder structure and few of it's features are similar to those presented in course AngularJS Line of Business Application by Deborah Kurata, which can be found here(https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/angularjs-line-of-business-applications) while some of the design principles(CSS, jQuery) were done similarly, transformed and build upon to those of Magister - Free Bootstrap Template under Creative Commons Attributions License. Template can be found here(https://www.gettemplate.com/info/magister/).

# How does it work? What does it do?

It was built and tested on local server using WampServer software. The app itself is depenendent on a couple of AngularJS modules
and controllers. The main concept of this app was to show as much AngularJS functionalities as possible while maintainaning
fluid frontend and stable app structure. It also uses vanilla JS(regex part), jQuery, Bootstrap, Bootrstrap UI and a 
little bit of a PHP and MySql.

Every option from main menu does the different thing. It is shown how to work with .json data(retriving, visualizing), then working 
with the fake backend(mocking data and http responses) and $resource service, working with AngularJS filters, 
validations of the contact form, restfull apis, routing with UI Router etc.

# How to install and test it?

This app needs web or local server for normal functioning. 
Download the .zip file and unzip it in the /www or similar folder within WampServer/XAMPP or similar software(for local environment),
RENAME the main app folder from "Diplomski-rad-master" to "Diplomski-rad" and then run the app. 
Everything should work properly.
